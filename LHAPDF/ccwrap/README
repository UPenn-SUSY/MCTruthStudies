LHAPDFWrap 

FREE SOFTWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

A C++ wrapper for the LHAPDF package.  Works with LHAPDFv2, v3.
Requires the gnu gcc compiler.

Adapted for LHAPDFv4 by Mike Whalley

INSTALLATION: 
- Unpack in a directory
- edit Makefile:
  LHAPDFDIR = "your path to libLHAPDF.a"
- edit test.cc and add the path to the member pdfs as distributed eg 
  ../PDFsets
- make
- ./test should give you some sample output for some pdf set

if all this works, you may just use the Makefile and test.cc as
templates in your own C++ programs.

WARNING!  Currently, the class is working fine if you work with only one
pdfset at a time.  Using two different sets via two different instances
of the LHAPDFWrap class is dangerous as they both point to the same
FORTRAN library in memory.

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO: You have to reinitialise the pdfset all the time in
your code whenever you switch pdfsets.  That is cumbersome and may waste
computing time.
